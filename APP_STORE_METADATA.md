TripWit is a simple, powerful travel planner that helps you organize every detail of your trip — from flights and hotels to day-by-day itineraries with every stop along the way.

**Plan Your Trips**
Create trips with destinations and dates. TripWit automatically generates a day-by-day schedule you can fill with stops — restaurants, attractions, activities, and more.

**Organize Every Stop**
Add stops to each day with arrival and departure times, notes, and categories. Search for places or tap "I'm Here" to instantly log your current location. See all your stops on an interactive map.

**Track Your Bookings**
Keep flights, hotels, and car rentals organized in one place. Store confirmation codes, airline details, hotel addresses, and check-in times so everything is at your fingertips.

**Weather Forecasts**
See the weather forecast for your destination right inside your trip. Plan around the rain and pack accordingly.

**Travel Times Between Stops**
View estimated driving and walking times between consecutive stops so you know exactly how long it takes to get from place to place.

**Photo Matching**
TripWit can match photos from your library to trip stops based on location and time — see your memories right alongside your itinerary.

**Share Your Itinerary**
Export any trip as a clean, detailed PDF to share with travel companions via Messages, email, AirDrop, or any other method.

**Privacy First**
All your data stays on your device. No accounts, no tracking, no ads. Your trips are yours alone.

## Export Compliance
Does your app use non-exempt encryption? **No**
(The app only uses standard HTTPS/TLS for network calls to the Open-Meteo weather API, which qualifies for the encryption exemption. `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption` is set to `NO` in Info.plist.)

## App Review Notes (paste into App Store Connect → App Review Information → Notes)

To quickly explore the app's full functionality:

1. On the welcome screen, tap "Load Example Trips" to populate the app with 3 sample trips (Paris, Tokyo, New York).
2. Tap the "Trips" tab to see the trip list, then tap a trip to see the day-by-day itinerary.
3. Tap a stop to see the stop detail view — you can add comments, get directions, and view matched photos (if any geotagged photos are in the simulator's photo library).
4. Tap the "Map" tab to see all stops plotted on an interactive map. Tap a marker to navigate to the stop detail.
5. Weather forecasts appear on any trip with future dates. The app uses the free Open-Meteo API (no API key required).
6. The "Share" button in the trip detail toolbar generates a PDF itinerary.
7. Photo matching requires photos with GPS metadata taken near trip stop locations.
8. On devices with Apple Intelligence (iOS 26+), additional AI-powered features appear: "Suggest with AI" on day itineraries, "Locate with AI" on stops, and "Explore Nearby" on stop details. These buttons are hidden on unsupported devices.

No login is required. All data is stored on-device only.
