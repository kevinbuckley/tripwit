### Prompt:
```
I'm uploading a screenshot from my iOS travel planning app "Travly". Create a stunning, polished App Store promotional screenshot at exactly 1290x2796 pixels.

Design specifications:
- Place the phone screenshot inside a realistic iPhone 15 Pro device frame (titanium finish), slightly angled 5-8 degrees to the right for depth
- The phone should be centered and take up about 65% of the vertical space, positioned in the lower 2/3
- Background: A rich gradient flowing from deep ocean blue (#0A2463) at the top to warm sunset coral (#FF6B35) at the bottom, with subtle abstract travel-themed shapes (faded compass rose, dotted flight path lines, or subtle world map contours) as texture
- Top headline in clean white sans-serif font (like SF Pro Display Bold): "Plan Every Detail"
- Subheadline below in lighter weight: "Organize trips, stops, and bookings in one place"
- Add a subtle warm glow/shadow behind the phone to make it pop
- Keep it minimal and premium — Apple-quality App Store aesthetic
- No watermarks, no extra text beyond the headlines

The overall vibe should feel premium, aspirational, and travel-inspired — like something you'd see from a top-tier travel app in the App Store.
